# Advanced-ML-Frameworks-for-Analyzing-and-Enhancing-Stability-Margins-in-PID-Controlled-Systems-
The framework uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) model trained on extensive datasets consisting of system  responses, controller parameters, and stability outcomes to identify  critical patterns, predict system stability, and suggest optimized PID tuning parameters that enhance  stability margins while maintaining desired performance metrics.

## The class of 0 is 60% and 1 is 40%. It is imbalanced.
